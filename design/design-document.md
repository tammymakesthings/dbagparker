# Project Summary

A monitor with sensors to determine the distance from wall(s) when parking
your car.

# Feature List

The following are *required* features:

- Wireless connection between main unit and distance sensor(s)
- Real-time display

The following are *nice to have* features:

- Ability to support multiple sensors (front, back, sides of car)
- Reporting of parking information with MQTT (button-activated?)

# Design Decisions

- [ ] What microcontroller are we using? SAMD, ESP8266, other?
- [ ] What sensors are we using? (MaxBotix ultrasonic? Laser?)
- [ ] How will the sensors connect to the mainboard? (BTLE, LoRA, etc.)
- [ ] What data to capture/report?

# Task List

## Hardware Design - Main Board

## Hardware Design - Sensor Board(s)

## Software Implementation

## Documentation

# Project Timeline/Milestones

1. Initial version - off-the shelf MCU board/breakouts
2. Design custom integrated board(s)?
